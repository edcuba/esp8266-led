## Course

Microprocessors and Embedded Systems, Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technology 2017.

## Description

The application provides a simple browser interface for controlling LEDs attached to ESP8266 board.
Server is runnning directly on ESP8266 board.
User can connect to the device using WiFi access point.
- SSID: ESP8266
- WPA2 password: xcubae00
- Server address: _192.168.4.1_
- Port: default (_80_)

## Commands

The interface contains a control button for each of three LEDs, blink sequence button, rotation sequence button and basic system information.

## Scheme

Controller is using two built-in LEDs (GPIO2 and GPIO16) and one external connected to GPIO4.
You may need to use 220 Ohm resistor for connecting your LED to GPIO4. See following pictures:

## Implementation

Project is implemented in MicroPython as simple iterative HTTP server using following predefined HTTP GET methods.

- **GET /TOOGLE_LED2** - toogles LED connected to GPIO2
- **GET /TOOGLE_LED4** - toogles LED connected to GPIO4
- **GET /TOOGLE_LED16** - toogles LED connected to GPIO16
- **GET /BLINK** - toogles blink sequence
- **GET /ROTATE** - toogles rotate sequence

Otherwise, **GET /$FILE** will return the required file (e.g. index.html) as usual.
Commands can be issued using web interface or directly (i.e. using _telnet_).

Web dashboard is using https://purecss.io framework.

HTML template is based on (changes 80% - reduced and simplified)

Stylesheet is based on (changes 5% - wrapped them together and changed the color scheme)

## Deployment

First you need to get MicroPython running on your board.
See this guide: http://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.9.3/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html

Then you need to copy in source files. You may use script _deploy.sh_ (requires _ampy_ to be installed).

## Summary

The application provides a simple interface for LED control.
Solution can be possibly used for building a "smart" home.

### Problems
- handling multiple devices at the time (iterative server due to limited RAM)
- dangers of using GET method for LED control (page reload executes command)
